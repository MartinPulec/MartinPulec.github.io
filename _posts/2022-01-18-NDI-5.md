From version [**1.7.2**](https://github.com/CESNET/UltraGrid/releases/tag/v1.7.2),
UltraGrid binary builds are built with NDI support
enabled. Even though the support is enabled, the library itself isn't bundled
but it is dynamically loaded from the system, which requires the redistributable
NDI to be installed (links in the wiki page below; for Linux, whole SDK
must be installed). For more info, please check
[this wiki-page](https://github.com/CESNET/UltraGrid/wiki/Syphon,-Spout-and-NDI#ndi).

_NDI_ support is enabled in
[**continuous**](https://github.com/CESNET/UltraGrid/releases/tag/continuous)
builds as well.
