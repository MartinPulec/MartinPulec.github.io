![NVIDIA Kepler](/img/Nvidia_Kepler.jpg)]<br />
Since the current UltraGrid comtinous build drop support of NVIDIA _Kepler_
chilps for **NVENC** in favor in _Linux_ of support for **AV1**, there is
a _new_ alternative build that can be found
[here](https://frakira.fi.muni.cz/~xpulec/ug-alt-builds/) that keeps the
support for Kepler chips.
