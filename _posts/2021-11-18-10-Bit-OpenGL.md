title: 10-bit OpenGL Support

In a development (continuous) version of UltraGrid, the OpenGL display now
supports native 10-bit RGB pixel format. Keep in mind that only `R10k` and
compressions that can output to that codec are displayed in 10-bits.

You can try it out by issuing:

    uv -t testcard:codec=R10k:pattern=gradient2 -d gl
    uv -t testcard:codec=R10k:pattern=gradient2 -c libavcodec:encoder=libx265 -d gl

You can visually compare to:

    uv -t testcard:codec=RGBA:pattern=gradient2 -d gl

Keep in mind that currently only a few compressions do support 10-bit RGB
natively (including `libx265` and `NVENC HEVC`). Support for **v210** may
arrive later.

If unsure if 10-bit works for you, pay attention to lines:

    [GL] Buffer depth - R: 10b, G: 10b, B: 10b

Currently 10-bit OpenGL was successfully tested with AMD and NVIDIA graphics
on Linux/X11.

**Note:** SDL2 display should presumably support 10-bit RGB pixel format as
well. But it doensn't seem to work reliably â€“ in our setup for instance a blank
screen is displayed, therefore it is not enabled by default. But you can
enforce it with `--param sdl2-r10k`:

    uv -d sdl --param sdl2-r10k
